# Python Utility Functions

A home for useful python functions with cross-cutting potential across projects

## Modules


## Contribution

Before adding a new function, please check to make sure there isn't an existing module in which the function could belong.
If there is none, create a new module with as generic a name as possible e.g. if you're adding a function that splits strings,
create a module called `strings.py` and add the function there.

Document your utility functions, clearly explaining their parameters and usage - do this both in the code and this read me under `modules`
